# DomoticHome
Arduino, Raspberry and HTTP Requests
The project is quite old and since the time I did it I've tried to improve my skills. There is a lot of work to do (code isn't very clear, most of the code isn't refactored and other stuff need to be done). But it is working so sooner or later I will make these changes.

A video example is here:

Dependecies:
  DHT11 library for Arduino.
  https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library/archive/master.zip
  
Contents:
HTM folder contains all the web pages for Arduino SD card reader.
DomoticHouse contains Arduino's code.

  
 All othere pages and code will be added as soon as possible.
