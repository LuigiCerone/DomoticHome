# DomoticHome
Arduino, Raspberry and HTTP Requests
The project is quite old and since the time I did it I've tried to improve my skills. There is a lot of work to do (code isn't very clear, most of the code isn't refactored and other stuff need to be done). But it is working so sooner or later I will make these changes.

A <b>video example</b> is here:
